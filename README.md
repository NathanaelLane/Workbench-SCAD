# Workbench

**A modern library for writing clean, organized parametric SCAD scripts.**

`! under construction !`

## Vision

The current (semi-)official standard library for OpenSCAD hasn't been updated in years. 
It wasn't meeting my needs, so I began to write my own helper scripts and functions.
This project is an attempt to gather all of that code, and hopefully similar bits and pieces written by other SCAD users, in one place.
The most important features I envision for Workbench development are:
* a clean, consistent coding style
* an automated testing and build system
* _extensive documentation_ on both development standards and library functionality

More to come. Watch this space.
